A function to check out  a Book : Whenever a user checks out a book, have the library make sure that both the user and the book are in the library. If they arenâ€™t, report an error. Then check to make sure that the user owes no fees. If the user does, report an error. If not, create a Transaction, and place it in the vector of Transactions. Also write a function that will return a vector that contains the names of all Patrons who owe fees.
